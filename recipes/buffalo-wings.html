    <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminium foil<br> 
            and set a heat-proof wire rack inside. </li><br>
        <li>Pat dry chicken wings liberally with paper towels, squeezing out as much moisture as you can. Transfer them to a large bowl.</li><br>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the baking powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper together, whisking well to combine, and sprinkle<br> 
            the mixture over the wings. Toss wings through the baking powder mixture until evenly coated.</li><br>
        <li>Arrange on rack, leaving about 1-inch of space between each wing.</li><br>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes; flip and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, (about 20-30 minutes longer), until golden browned<br> 
            and crispy.</li><br>
        <li>While wings are cooking, whisk together hot sauce, butter and sugar. Toss wings through the sauce to evenly coat.</li><br>
        <li>Serve wings immediately with blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing, and celery sticks.</li><br>
