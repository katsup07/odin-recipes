       the secret to making delicious toppoki.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>1 pound of cylinder shaped rice cake, bought or homemade. (Use a little more if you’re not adding hard boiled eggs and fish cakes)</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li> 7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
        <li> 6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
        <li>⅓ cup hot pepper paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 green onions, cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
        <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled (optional)</li>
        <li> ½ pound fish cakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li><br>
        <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li><br>
        <li>Combine hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and kelp from the pot<br>
            and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs.<br>
            The stock will be about 2½ cups. </li><br>
        <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the sauce<br>
            thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 -15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water<br> 
            and continue stirring until soften. When you use freshly made rice cake, it takes shorter time. If you use frozen rice<br> 
            cake, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.</li><br>
