        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li><br>
        
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente<br> 
            8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li><br>
        
        <li>Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, <br>
            thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.</li><br>
        
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li><br>
        
        <li>Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop<br> 
            the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle<br> 
            about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over <br>
            the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.</li><br>
        
        <li>Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li><br>
